       "  'review': 'I order this pie anytime I am lucky enough to go to the Angus Barn, however when I tried making it myself using this recipe, my pie didn&#039;t end up tasting much like the restaurant version. For one thing, it seemed too sweet. It may be that the recipe requires unsweetened coconut, but I wasn&#039;t sure and what seems most easy to find in grocery stores is sweetened. If you use sweetened coconut I would recommend decreasing the amount of sugar you add. The other problem was that my pie wasn&#039;t as firm as the restaurant&#039;s version. I used liquid eggwhites but couldn&#039;t find a good conversion chart for the 7 eggwhites the recipe calls for. I used a cup of the liquid eggwhites and it was too much. Last but not least, a homemade crust probably tastes best. I used a frozen shell and my pie was just so-so.&lt;br/&gt;At the restaurant this pie is served with both whipped cream and sliced bananas on the top. Since my pie was a little sweet, sprinkling nutmeg and/or cinnamon on top of the bananas seemed to help cut the sweetness a little and complimented the pie nicely.',\n",

Only changes I made were 2 cloves of garlic sauted with the onion, whole milk instead of half/half, and I only added about five ounces of cheese as opposed to eight. Seemed like 8 ounces was a bit much for such a small volume of soup. The soup thickened up beautifully. Creamy and thick without being overly rich. For those who complain that this has no flavor, I am baffled. My first guess is lack of salt. The soup does require a good bit of salt and pepper, but that's the nature of any recipe. You salt as you go, and add as much as you think it needs to bring out the flavor. My second guess is using a bland supermarket cheese. I used a good quality cheddar from Trader Joe's. Not expensive at all, but way more flavor than the bland rubbery stuff. I will definitely be making this again.\",\n",

And added 12 oz of fat--though I only had 8 ounces of lard and used 4 of butter.  I couldn&#039;t find my pastry blender so I used knife and fork and cut the butter and flour together.  It seemed like way too much fat for the amount of flour.  I don&#039;t know if my scale failed massively (though I don&#039;t think so) or what.  I added a little extra flour.  I used the smallest egg I had.  I only added two tablespoons of ice water.  I turned down my AC.  I kept returning everything to the fridge.  And then, when I looked in the oven, the crust had slumped down the side of the pie plate to a greasy puddle in the middle of the pan.  I&#039;ve never made a perfect, beautiful crust, but this was my greatest failure by miles.  I&#039;m not using stars.

However I make it slightly differently: I replace coconut liqueur with marsala (I use All'uovo Bookmark Crema - I'm not really sure how any of these words relate.. but it's what's on the bottle :) It's also VERY cheap AU$7 a bottle here). Marsala is used in Tirimisu.<br/>Instead of wrapping up the sauce mixture and banana in alfoil (I find it leaks and doesn't fully cover the bananas), I put it all (excluding the bananas) into a small saucepan (a 14.5cm one is perfect for one) and add about 1 tsp of all spice. Leave the banana out to start with and mix the ingredients over low-med heat until it starts foaming and the sugar has dissolved. Chop up the bananas into ~2cm rounds and add it to the sauce mixture and stir for a bit, then let it bubble slowly over low heat. Once the banana is soft it's done and you can take it off the heat.<br/>Pour over a stack of two-three pancakes and drop some vanilla icecream balls on top and you'll be in heaven!<br/><br/>PS. Also tried with gluten free flour (not sure what grain) and dairy-free butter (Nuttelex) and it was also amazing!\",\n",

On Sunday past (2012), I woke up with such a craving for this soup...and stumbled upon your recipe.<br/><br/> we read the recipe in a hurry and mistakenly boiled the onions, tomatoes and garlic in HALF a LITRE of OLIVE OIL. once we realized our mistake, i have to admit we were quite worried; but with the price of olive oil, we decided not to start over and simply continued...<br/><br/>We couldn't find monk fish at the local grocery store, but, I assure you, this soup was so authentic and satisfying, even with our flub up, that I was whisked back to Rayol Canadel and will definitely keep this one to impress my friends who might otherwise turn up their noses at the sound of 'fish soup' (yes, admitedly, i have some of those).<br/><br/>thanks!\",\n",

It did&#039;nt give off that comfy &quot;pot roast is cooking&quot; aroma but a rather off-putting pukey smell.  &lt;br/&gt;I micro-baked several small potatoes, squashed them down on the plates and put the gravy over them.  &lt;br/&gt;The meat was tender but very strange tasting. &lt;br/&gt;I was grateful that it was just my husband and myself for this meal.  We did eat it for dinner but the rest went into the garbage.&lt;br/&gt;I think that there were way too many competing spices in this recipe and it ended up being just &quot;gunk&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;I won&#039;t try it again, even with modifications.

I let them rise for longer than 10 minutes, only because I had lots of other things going on in the kitchen so they had to wait their turn for the oven.

Making 12, you do end up with slider size, but as they&#039;re quite soft I think they&#039;d fall apart as burger rolls if they were bigger - so sliders is fine by me.

These were the most colorful crab cakes I\\'d made. I didn\\'t make the honey mustard sauce, only because we had just had salad this week with that type of dressing. I made a chipotle alioli to top. These turned out terrific and my husband was a \"happy camper!\" Looking forward to leftovers tomorrow. Thanks, Kitten!\\r\\n\\r\\nRoxygirl',\n",

My baking time also took much longer than the recipe indicated (close to 40 minutes).

I served this for dinner last night with Chicken & Lime Soup #3768, and they complimented each other nicely. Originally I was going to make rolls out of this (for some reason the kids will eat homemade bread more readily in roll rather than loaf form), but it just screamed great big rustic loaf to me, so that is what I did, one great big free form loaf. I will divide it in two loaves next time (think it might rise higher that way), but I could not have asked for a more beautiful bread. The crumb was so moist. The flavor was awesome, it smelled divine. I have found another new bread to love, and love it I shall. I will most definitely be making this frequently.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I am rating this for the cinnamon rolls.  My daughter is allergic to eggs and soy, and I was looking for a hamburger bun recipe suitable for her.  I saw this recipe and while I am going to make the hamburger buns, I immediately wanted to make the cinnamon rolls.  I had previously been unsuccessful in finding a cinnamon roll recipe that didn&#039;t have eggs (that I felt compelled to make).  I got my bread machine out last night as my husband was cooking dinner.  I warmed the milk to about 110 degrees and then proceeded with adding the rest of the ingredients.  90 minute later I was rolling out my rectangle of dough (and very excited).  I spread a half a stick of butter (maybe a little less) over the dough and then I spread 1 cup of brown sugar mixed with 2 1/2 tablespoons of cinnamon over the butter.  Patted it down and very gently put my rolling pin over the surface.  I rolled them tightly and cut them at least 1 3/4 inches (I tried dental floss cutting, but went with my sushi knife instead).  I placed them cut side down in two round foil pans.  One pan got wrapped and put in the freezer.  The other pan I wrapped and put in the refrigerator.  Before I went to bad, I turned on the oven light and set the pan of cinnamon rolls in the oven (do NOT turn on oven).  This morning, they were ready to bake when I got up.  I put together a frosting (2 oz cream cheese, 7 tbls butter, 2 tablespoons milk, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/4 tsp salt and 1 1/2 cups confectioners sugar).  These were AMAZING.  My daughter is over the moon happy (which makes me happy) and my husband said they were awesome as well!',\n",

I did find that 1 tsp. of salt was quite a lot, so next time, I'll use half that amount. Also, since I can't seem to leave well enough alone...I added a bit ( maybe 1/8 tsp.) of ground cloves, and 1/2 cup of raisins to the batter.  They smelled deliciously spicy, and ready, before the 20 minute baking time was up, so I'd suggest keeping an eye (and nose) on them.  I always fill muffin tins nearly-to-the-brim with batter, and I was rewarded with 10 very generous muffins. My friends will love getting some of these...to enjoy with their coffee or tea!

Very tasty, but you could not pick the slices up nor cut them easily with a fork.  Ok, I think, I just put too many toppings on.  Third one made for husband later.  I decide to precook the bottom tortilla for a bit to give it a head start.  Decreased toppings while keeping in mind that too many toppings would give the same result.  Same result.  Oven temp maybe?  Would like to say however, that even though husband couldn&#039;t pick up nor cut slice with a fork (he used a knife) he actually complimented the pizza. And that is VERY unusual for a super picky person!  He tossed last night&#039;s dinner in the garbage and refused to eat it! Thank you very much for sharing.',\n",

That would suggest a bogus review system or individuals who take the time to lie in a review about bread? Doubtful. 3rd.) The Baker&#039;s percent (ratio) for this recipe is 125% (roughly) of the flour.

Dried works just fine. <br/>--I also cooked my shrooms down pretty well, to the point where they were a very deep, dark brown, and the olive oil had nearly caramelized them. (I know that is not technically the correct description, but you get my drift.) <br/>--I did skip the pepper though I might try them with it some other time. <br/>--I used 2 packages of pre-sliced bella caps, and it seemed to be the proper amount for the flavoring. <br/>--I might have been a little more liberal with the garlic than the recipe called for & I also just used the pre-minced stuff. <br/><br/>((Made about 2 servings, as a main dish))<br/><br/>Served with brown rice topped with a blend of rosemary, basil, and marjoram (ground with a mortar and pestle - heavy on the rosemary),  and green peas.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Simple, quick, delicious.\",\n",

After sauteeing the onions, peppers, garlic and spices, I moved them to a bowl.  Then cooked up the pumkin and curry paste.  After 5 minutes added the onions and pepers back in and continued with the dish. Managed to also reduce the total amount of oil to 1 tablespoon by using some extra vegetable stock to soften the onions.  Used fresh tomatoes but think this would work equally well with the canned variety. My final tweak was that I used a very ripe plaintain instead of the banana, a simple matter of availability and preference for cooking with plantains as they hold there shape a bit better.  Will certainly make this soon as it was thoroughly enjoyed.  Imagining variations with small amounts of chicken in lieu of some of the chickpeas, or a light addition of allspice.

Rather than expressing disappointment in the recipe the best thing would be for the person making this dish to look at their ingredients.  I followed the recipe to the letter and not problems.  I even added onions to the mashed potatoes.  Less eggs for watery mash ans more eggs for dry mash.  They fry up very nicely and DO NOT fall apart.  I stuffed mine with sausage.  Great recipe',\n",

My husband, who is &quot;tolerating&quot; our new lifestyle, asked for seconds and said it was the most delicious pancake he had ever had! I put a couple of thin slices of banana on top (they looked like butter pats so that helped ;) and maybe a Tbsp of maple syrup. WOW!

       "  'review': \"I made this Jello salad in a Bundt pan and brought it to a Labor Day picnic.  Everyone was thrilled at the postmodern irony inherent in the Jello mold, plus they all thought it was delicious.  This recipe was just a smidge too big for a 12-cup Bundt pan, so I ended up with about 2 cups of extra Jello in custard cups.  If I do it again, I'll probably do just one package for the top layer (since that's the skinniest part of the Bundt pan).  The very first layer didn't glom on well to the middle layer and as the salad warmed up on the table, the top slid slowly off in slow-motion jiggly lime-green avalanche, which was hilarious.  If you're going to try this in a mold, and you prefer structural integrity to hilarity, I recommend that you start mixing the center layer a bit before the first layer is firm, and add the second layer exactly at the 2-hour mark. I sprayed my pan with non-stick cooking spray, and it just warmed up naturally on the way to the picnic, and it unmolded beautifully.  A fun recipe!  Thanks!\",\n",

It was an easy recipe to fix and then toss in the crockpot to cook for the day.  I did sub some ingredients but don't feel that it changed the flavor.  I didn't have any tomatoe sauce so I used a small can of tomatoe paste, a 101/2 oz can of beef broth that was double strength.  I didn't drain anything just opened cans and tossed in the crock.  I do think that you could use other kinds of beans.  I fixed this with Recipe #151669 and it was a yummy dinner.  Thank you onlyme for posting this keeper.  Shirl\",\n",

The problem was the baby oil and the amount of it. I had quite a bit of oil sitting on top of the sugar after I mixed it all together. When I used the scrub in the shower it made the tub very, very slippery. My skin felt very smooth and nice after the shower but I had a hard time getting the oily film off of me. I didnt see in the directions a set time to let this sugar scrub sit and maybe soak up some of the oil so not sure if I should have let the scrub sit for a day or two. If the oil problem was cleared up this would be a nice scrub. Sorry this didnt work out the best for me. :( Thank you for sharing Chef # Rachal Ray Fan.

You start the meat in a low temperature oven first, with a thermometer. Bring it up to about 118 degrees F and let it rest for 5-10 minutes, the meat will continue to cook about 2 to 3 degrees after you have taken it out. The final step should be searing 2-3 minutes on the hottest your pan can handle and then finally another 10 minutes of rest. You will have the juiciest, perfectly cooked medium rare steak with a nice crust.',\n",

I came back tonight (while my meat is browning to make yet another go-round) to make sure I had given this five stars (I had). This recipe is so versatile. I have made it with onion powder & garlic powder, and even no onion at all - I prefer the original, although I now cut my onion *very* small since my kids are picky onion-haters. ;) I have also, at various points on my low-carb journey, used Sweet & Low Brown, Splenda with a dash of blackstrap molasses, and plain Splenda. Again, I prefer the original, but these substitutes are do-able. (I don't recommend leaving the brown sugar out entirely - I did once, and it just didn't have the right balance of flavors.) I usually don't find that my sauce stays thin. It usually cooks down and caramelizes beautifully.  I have found that it doesn't do that when I double the recipe, and I don't like the result as much, so I try to use 2 pans to double this. I usually use pork country ribs. I guess that's about it, except to profusely thank MaeEast for posting such a wonderful recipe!  \",\n",

The toasted coconut does add a delightful flavor and texture to this nice bread, which is not overly sweet but is sweet enough to be very satisfying.

The first time I used 2tbsp which was even worse! . I might use 1/2tbsp next time. Or maybe I didn't add enough sugar? This is a good basic recipe to tweak but following the recipe 100% wont get you the best pancakes hence why I gave 4/5. They taste good with peanut butter smeared on them to hide the saltiness though. I also added in 1tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of vanilla essence. I had some plain and with toppings. i made 8 small ones and ate half at home for breakfast this morning and the other half at work as a snack!

You could also add some minced onion but should sautee the onion first so that it is not hardwhen cooked.  Here in the philippines we might even add a vegetable called pechie. Mince it up and it will enhance the recipe with timy bits of green coloring,,,add a minced red tomato and you have a very colorful and full of flavour, breakfast...  just some thoughts to enhance an allready great recipe..enjoy!',\n",

I used recipe #9186 for the brownies, fresh strawberries, Best Choice French Vanilla pudding, and Best Choice non-dairy whipped topping.  I also didn't have a clear bowl, so I layered this into individual bowls, one of each other layers (except the choc shell... I didn't once over the strawberries and once over the pudding/whipped cream mix)  This was so yummy!  I love the burst of tartness from the strawberries.  The texture of the pudding and whipped topping went very well with fruit and crumbled brownie.  The shell hadn't set up hard but was just firm.  The whole thing was very much a delight.  I made a whole recipe which was likely a mistake my waistline will grow to regret, but DH liked it enough that this may not be too much of a problem.  Thank you for the keeper recipe!\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I made these, and was worried that they would not hold together as another reviewer stated. I could not get them to clump together like traditional crabcakes, so I just mashed them into the pan (make sure you use metal- my silicone bakeware did not work, but that was my fault, not the Chef's), and hoped for the best. After baking, I just turned the hot metal pan over on a platter, and they all fell out and looked almost like real crabcakes (but the shape of a muffin cup). I did not have quite enough fresh crab on hand, so I supplemented with some diced salad shrimp- no problem at all! I mixed Valdalia and green onion, and used fresh dill and lemon juice. The combination of stronger spices surprised me, but, we all ate the crabcakes (crab/shrimp cakes), and there were no leftovers! They were such a hit, that I made them again two nights ago, but used leftover salmon since I was still out of crab, and because of this recipe, also out of shrimp. It's a great concept, and one I will be using again and again! As a bonus, the entire house smelled like some wonderful, exotic dish. I had my oven hood on to draw some of the heat outside, and neighbors were asking what I cooked. I gave them this website for the recipe, so I can bet that Chef Garlic will be getting many more reviews before too long! <br/><br/>As an aside, I always make this lemon, dill pickle juice and onion sauce (really watery, but sorta like a tarter sauce flavor, without the mayo), when we have any sort of seafood. It makes up great on the seafood, as a pasta base, marinade, or for a sandwich the next day. But, nobody touched it when I made this recipe. My feelings were hurt about that, but it did save me some work, as I hate chopping. <br/><br/>Also, make sure you use mayo, and not that other stuff with a blue lid that doubles as a salad dressing. The sugar in the M.W. would make it way too sweet. Maybe use regular stuffing mix if you use M.W.? But, I really liked the flavor of the cornbread stuffing with the contrast of the seafood. <br/><br/>In addition, the recipe says that it makes one serving, but, we had 4.8 adults that ate from it. The 0.8 is because one is due to deliver in about 3 weeks. I'll cut the recipe in half, or perhaps freeze part of it when the extra 2.8 people go home after she gives birth. <br/><br/>Overall, I have been impressed with this recipe, and pleasently surprised by how well everyone enjoyed it. Having to please 3.8 other picky adults, I felt this was a winner since there was nothing left either time. The flavor is much stronger than any crabcake I have ever had, but with the cornbread, it was a lot more distinctive, too. If you use metal muffin tins, and just press the back of the spoon down hard on top of the muffin tin, there will be no worries about them not holding together. One high dollar famous crabcake maker on the Chesapeke had crabcakes that did not stick together as well as these, and we always go back there a few times a year because they are so good. I have found that using a local farm's organic eggs over commerical grocery store varieties seemed to help keep the cakes together. My old go to recipe for crabcakes usually fell apart all the time <br/><br/>As a personal tip, I enjoyed the ones where I only filled the cup about 1/2 way full, as they came out tasting more like the fried version since more area was able to be baked. They were amazing, and you could taste all of the flavors seperately, and melding together. Mmmm, I want them again after writing this review!\",\n",

But that is just my personal taste.\\n\\nSecond,  I did not like the roasted garlic, plain garlic to me had a much better flavor.\\n\\nThird, I preferred shitakis, vs white mushrooms, it gave a much deeper flavor which I thought was needed.\\n\\nPersonal experience, using a Qtip can get fibers from the tip on the wonton.  I use my finger to moisten always.\\n\\nSpraying the steamer, I use a bamboo steamer, you may just want to clarify that. A bamboo steamer doesn't need to be steamed as some teflon coated ones don't need either.\\n\\nLast ... Clarify the difference between Shanghai wonton wrappers and regular wrappers.  Shanghai wrappers do not have egg in the dough whereas a regular wonton wrapper does. They do have a bit of a different taste and they are not as easily found.  They are only available at my Asian Market whereas all my grocery store carry wonton wrappers.\\n\\nBut overall a nice flavor and thx for sharing\\nKim\",\n",

I followed the recipe exactly, ended up adding 4 cups of whole wheat flour to the dough. Tips for beginners like me - to determine how much flour is enough, your dough should not stick to your hand or countertop, it should peel away from the side of mixing bowl or your hand but still feel a little sticky.  If the dough sticks, add some more flour.  I knead the dough in Kitchen Aid stand mixer at speed 2 for 10 minutes.  another tip for beginners, when kneading your dough in the Kitchenaid mixer, your dough should form a ball/balloon hooked on the hook, moving with the mixer hook, and it should look like a balloon been squeezed between the walls of the mixer bowl and the hook.  For warm water, I used 110F degrees for both sponge and dough. When baking, when the temperature inside the bread reaches about 190-200 degrees it's ready.

       "  'review': \"Sadness. This recipe sounded so good but was the bomb at my Thanksgiving table. My guests took 2-3 bites of theirs to be polite. I could barely force mine down. The problem? WAY too sweet! This is probably not Nanita's fault. I guess I should have stopped to think for 1 second that if my yams were canned in SYRUP, they would need less than a whole 1/2 cup of sugar in the recipe, but who has an extra second to think on Thanksgiving Day? Also, I think the bottom layer of sweet potatoes was too mushy as it didn't get sufficient exposure to the heat. This would probably be solved if I used fresh yams, or spread the canned yams out over two baking dishes in 1 thin layer to thicken with the heat. I won't be making this again, so guess I'll never know.\",\n",

I used homogenized milk, Carnation evaporated milk instead of cream, allspice in a lesser amount in place of nutmeg as we do not consume intoxicants, & freshly squeezed lemon juice. Made for Yummy, fun for a change which I made gluten free!! DD1 (4 years old) and I enjoyed them and I plan to make them again for DH. I used brown rice flour, white rice flour and tapioca starch for the all purpose flour (half the amount of starch to flour), homogenized milk, sweet butter (unsalted), bananas mixed into the brown sugar, and Balkan (thick) yogurt to be corn free. I'd say this make 2 large servings not 4 as you don't cut the pancake in half. I will make this recipe again. Made for Veggie Swap #45 ~ April 2012 ~\",\n",

I ended up adding the freshly brewed coffee and the butterscotch chips in a small saucepan, and cooked that over a low temp on top the stove, to help dissolve the chips into the coffee. I then added the half-and-half, and heated the coffee through. I did not add any sugar, as I found the butterscotch chips had sweetened the coffee enough.

The steaming bowl was just sitting under my nose tempting me to eat it first and take a picture of whatever was left. Luckily I was able to hold out. <br/>I chose the crock pot method, but I added the cumin in the begining (by accident) with everything but the sour cream. Also, I added more cilantro (a weakness of mine), broth and red peppers. I added a few dashes of chili powder to add a little spice. I chose to use boneless, skinless chicken thighs. I put them in whole and frozen & broke them into bite-size pieces right before I added the sour cream.<br/>When I did add the sour cream in the last half hour, I only added half of what the recipe calls for. I added the remainder as dollops in each bowl, garnished with some more chopped cilantro.<br/>We made biscuit nuggets (recipe to be posted shortly) and dipped them in the soup. AWESOME combo!<br/>I have 3 daughters and they all loved it! My 11 y.o. asked if she could take some to school for lunch the next day, adding \"if there\\'s any left over\". My 3 y.o. decided she liked to scoop the soup with the cooked onions as if they were chips and dip (she\\'s never liked onions before) better than she liked eating it with a spoon. And my 2 y.o. was speechless. She was too busy chowing down to talk!  I\\'d say that\\'s 5 stars from each of us.<br/>Thank you sooo much for sharing this recipe! I will be making this again.

       "  'review': \"Really enjoyed this!! Very creamy and saucy, which I like! Of course, mine may have been more so b/c I doubled the recipe and used Barilla Plus elbows, and their box is 14 oz (or 14.5), so it was slightly less mac than called for. I would do that again to ensure sauciness! I did take other reviewers advise and reduced the flour a bit... again b/c I like a saucy mac and cheese.  So, I used 1/8 cup per batch (1/4 cup, since I doubled it). I also increased cheese by about a cup -- b/c I wanted to use up all my half packs of grated cheese... I don't think this was necessary, and I wouldn't insist on doing it again (though extra cheesy is always fine, too!!) Otherwise, I added more spice to it - I actually put in a bit of cumin and ground red pepper into the butter. And I mixed in some hot sauce when all mixed up, as well. It was really delicious!!! Will def be making this again!! Thank you!\",\n",

I love Thai, and I love peanut sauces, and this one is a keeper, I also loved how tender the chicken was after being cooked in coconut milk! I topped it with some fresh coriander, which worked great! I was unable to buy any spinach on the day I wanted to cook this, so I just served it in bowls with some brown rice.  The only problem i had with it was I thought there was way too much fish sauce. I had to double all the other sauce ingredients (except the sugar)to get rid of the overpowering fishy taste. Next time I make it, I will only add 1-2 TB of each of the fish sauce & brown sugar. I recommend anyone trying this recipe to just add the fish sauce gradually until you have the taste you like. Great recipe though, and definately one I will make again! PS: Is even better the next day! :) [Made for PRMR]',\n",

       "  'review': \"This was a really nice tasting pie.  The only difficulties I had was not knowing when to add the brown sugar, since the directions do not specify.  It made the most sense to me to add the brown sugar to the pumpkin, spices and salt in step 5, so I added it there.  I'm glad I had all the ingredients pre-measured (as you suggested) otherwise I would have missed adding the sugar altogether.  The filling didn't seem to set completely, which may have been a result of covering the entire pie with aluminum foil while it was baking (which I opted to use because I don't have a crust shield). Your method of baking the pie shell for fifteen minutes really helps maintain a perfectly flaky bottom crust!  I will definately buy a crust shield and continue using this method in the future.\",\n",

This was the perfect balance for us and worked wonderfully. The directions are spot on and the finished product came off splendidly. It is important to let this cool down for an hour or to to allow the caramel time to set up and give a nice crunch to the popcorn (although it smells so good, this is somewhat difficult to achieve, lol).

First, the thinner chicken breasts were much more juicy and tender than the thick ones.  Ultimately, the areas that were immersed were tender and juicy.  The areas on top that were sticking out of the sauce were dryer but still had good flavor.  The flavor was very pronounced without marinating and my younger kids had a little trouble with the different flavors.  We did serve this over rice.  The first couple of bites I was thinking that I would cut down the five spice to 1/4 tsp next time because that flavor was a little overwhelming, the next couple of bites I was thinking Wow..I'm not a orange zest fan at all but every bite I had with it was better than the bites without. So, I give this a big thumbs up and it will definately be something I will make in the crockpot next time and I will make sure the chicken is covered next time and up the zest and cut back a little on the five spice.  This rocked! Thanks for the recipe, Pamela.\",\n",

This was gone lickity split & my guests loved it.  Maybe the CREAM CHEESE mentioned in the description should have been added to the ingredient list??? I didn't use cream cheese, but it could have been omitted? It was confusing that it's mentioned in the description and not included in the recipe.\",\n",

It some how managed to be too sweet and too salty all at once.
