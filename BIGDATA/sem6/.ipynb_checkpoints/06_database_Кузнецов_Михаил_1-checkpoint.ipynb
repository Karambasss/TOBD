The glaze is TDF good, a fudgy smooth consistency, and even DH who doesn\\'t like coconut thought the shredded coconut on top was perfect. So, for taste we all would agree on a definite 5 stars. :) My concern is that the recipe could benefit from some modifications & clarifications. The first thing I would want to point out is that the recipe as printed doesn\\'t make just \"large\" cupcakes. It will make JUMBO cupcakes. I don\\'t have a jumbo pan so I would have cut the recipe down had I known before hand. Instead I ended up making 36 regular sized cupcakes & because they had to be cooled in the pan before removing to wire rack (& because of the cakes\\' texture, this was in fact necessary) it took 3 hours just to bake all 36 cakes (2 days from start to finish). As far as the recipe, I think there is much too much butter. So much that the muffin tins felt as if I\\'d greased them before putting the paper liners in, but I didn\\'t. I also think the amount of sugar called for is overkill. They didn\\'t taste overly sweet, but the tops of the cakes are nearly caramelized. The butter sank to the bottom & made the cake greasy while the sugar floated to the top & turned into a sticky candy coating. Removing the cakes from the pan &/or removing the paper liners without tearing the entire top of the cake was a very slow & tedious process. I did enough to get a satisfactory photo but will just let everyone remove their own now. :) Again, this recipe is worth the effort in flavor & we would give 5 stars for that. Thanks for sharing, my3bb! Made for ZWT5-Ali Baba\\'s Babes.  UPDATE:  It\\'s been 4 days since I made these & they\\'ve been sitting out on the counter the whole time (not covered or sealed).  I just finished eating one & cannot believe that it\\'s still SO GOOD!  They\\'re not greasy anymore & still aren\\'t dried out.  The cake is still moist & only just approaching the \"day old\" stage around the top edge that isn\\'t in paper or covered in frosting.  The frosting is like biting into a rich, creamy fudge & was such a nice surprise.  I\\'m tempted to say that making these a day or two ahead of an event would be just perfect as far as their aging to perfection & the convenience of being able to make a baked good ahead.  :)'],\n",

The crusts were very hard, but I baked the bread without the caps on top of the molds. For softer crusts, I would probably slather the loafs with butter as soon as they were out of the tubes. I like tough crusts, though, and will probably not use a bread mold next time I make this because it kind of reminded me of the baguettes at Panera Bread. Great recipe!\"],\n",

I did sustitute ground turkey (didn't have a chilli pepper), opted for peas, and otherwise stuck to the recipe. The first test batch was less than impressive, the wonton wrappers were a dry/crisp and dull, so after asking-used a very light brush of oil and a pinch of salt made them soft and inviting(can also use cooking oil spray). I found the spice level/combination very agreeable but felt it was repetitious(maybe because of the turkey being less powerful than beef) and in need something. I noticed other people use rasins or sultanas so I chopped some for a second test batch--yummy! They added a needed contrast for my liking and the taste was complete. I wanted to give 5 stars but I've never had Samosas before so I can't say how traditional these taste.\\nAs far as quantity,I made 12-15 filled wonton wraps and filled a small burrito wrap for neighbor to munch on and still had about 3/4 of the mixture remaining (in the fridge for tommorow) so I'd say #60 individual peices easily.

So I decided to give this a try (If you can't trust Fannie who can you trust? Oh and Carla too lol) As others mentioned it doesn't dry out once baked, but when cooled slightly you get that nice sliceable quality. I used extra sharp cheddar and evaporated milk for the cream.

This dessert is simple, quick and easy, and kids and adults both love it. Peanut butter adds flavor as well as creaminess to plain old instant pudding. This dessert is also a good source of protein for fussy kids. Could be fancied up with chocolate sauce or shavings, whipped cream, peanut butter cups, just about anything, but I really enjoyed it plain. Thanks, Darlene, for sharing!\"],\n",

I ended up using part bread flour as I ran out of all-purpose and didn&#039;t want to let my dough sit while I opened up a new bag.  Due to oven space constraints, I just baked it in two one-pound loaf pans, turned it out at the end and rubbed the tops with butter.  Baking soda breads rise quite high, so I only let it get to barely the tops of the pans and it was perfect.  It was very easy to make and it seemed like each rising only took about 45 minutes or so.  Next time, I will have everything measured in the mixer bowl before I start the yeast.  I was gathering all of the other ingredients and suddenly noticed I had a yeast volcano going!!

I also garnished with some fresh basil, and some ancho chile powder, both flavors that really enhance the corn.  Although the recipe calls for straining the mixture before serving, I opted not to, and instead used a hand blender to puree it even more finely in the pan.  I like the texture this way, and so did DH.  He actually thought it should be a bit thicker, which I may accomplish next time by adding a little flour between steps one and two.  My only issue, and it's a minor one, was the balance of flavor between the corn and the onion.  I thought the onion was a little strong, so next time I think I'll either use a little less, or use a sweet onion instead of the plain yellow onion that I used this time.

This  turned out perfectly and I received MANY compliments! The best compliment was when someone asked if there was yeast in it, like in cinnamon rolls. I explained that it just puffs up when baked. I think that is the neatest part of it! I had pancake syrup for a topping but most ate it plain (but this dish is anything but plain!) and sprinkled it liberally with powdered sugar. For ease of cutting I reccomend lining the two layers up together. I suggest to others to let the casserole rest before cutting and lift up some pieces of the bread so the melted butter distributes throughout the pan.

I always approach kugel recipes as fair game: an opportunity to vary what I throw in and what I omit according to the whim of the moment.  It was a while since I'd made kugel so I approached making this dish with considerable enthusiasm.  I made a few changes because of personal taste preferences and a few additions because I love the additional ingredients.  I omitted the hot pepper sauce and used only 1/2 teaspoon of worcestershire sauce (we have almost zero tolerance of anything hot and spicy), I doubled the garlic and I added an onion and one leek: just love the combination of onions, garlic and leek.  I also added a cup of thinly sliced mushrooms.  I added basil and oregano (as in the ingredients list) but also added rosemary, sage and thyme. I used low-fat cottage cheese and low-fat sour cream as I find that low-fat versions of these makes no appreciable difference to the final dish.  Once all the ingredients had been combined, I added two eggs - as eggs have featured in most other kugel recipes I've made.  I baked the kugel in several smaller dishes as two were destined for the freezer.  I look forward to making this again - probably quite differently next time.  Thank you for sharing this recipe, Oolala!  Made for Revised Bargain Basement.\"],\n",

Finally, I served them over steamed basmati rice & garnished with some fresh, chopped green onions (also from my garden).  Delicious lunch!  I GNOME I will make this again!

You can use a smaller baking dish, you don't need a 9X13 if you're creating 3 layers. I served this on whole wheat angel hair and instead og canned tomato sauce, I used a jar of pasta sauce.

For a cookie cake you preferably have a pan with sides, or put tin foil or a cookie sheet under it to catch messes. I thought about making a tin foil ridge underneath but forgot to try it. Make a slight indentation in the middle, like making a burger, so it is easier to cook through in the middle. Leave an inch or two of space around the outside of the dough to allow for spreading.

Not because I was doing something from experience, but rather I am a new cook who hasn't used much paprika and was a bit hesitant to put the whole 3 tablespoons in, not sure what it would do to the taste since it was already looking and smelling so good. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I believe there is something missing (more than the paprika I left out). I'm sure adding more salt would help but instead of having to use a lot of salt I'm hoping someone else can figure out a good additional ingredient to push this yummy recipe to a 5. I made it with uncle ben's white rice (my new fav. rice) adding a spoonful of cream cheese to the rice when fluffing at the end. If you've never tried that it's really good! I would have liked to have a good vggie on the side too but couldn't decide on one so I didn't make any! Anyway it tasted so good along side the rice I began to mix it up all together spreading the sauce and fish throughout the rice. Gasp!! Just looked at the recipe again.  I think I figured it out-I left out the OJ!!!  Well, problem solved.  That prob would have given it a 5.  But hey it was still really yummy without.  Good stuff.

I chopped the fruit finely but not all the way to a paste - it filled to the brim a quart mason jar. I then poured in as much rum as it would hold (maybe several cups) and turned the jar over every several days for about a month. I baked it in two regular size loaf pans for 2 3/4 hours. I would have preferred the mini loaf pans but forgot to get them. The loaves are now wrapped in cheesecloth which I've soaked several times with more rum, and then wrapped in foil.

I was recently over at my sisters house and while getting Ice cubes for a drink I saw Whole frozen Bananas in her freezer. This is a great idea when you only have one or two bananas left. Throw them in the freezer ( with peel on ) , collecting them until you get around to making the bread. No more waste of bananas in our house. We made a batch yesterday from the frozen ones and it was equally as good as using fresh bananas.'),\n",

Some notes:  The caraway, which is optional, is what really made the dish delicious and a bit different.  I used chicken leg quarters, which I cut, removing whatever fat I could.  For ease, I used my food processor to chop the garlic and parsley, then added the Italian dressing, 1 t. salt and some pepper.  Marinated in a freezer bag overnight.  I cut the carrots into chunks and used lots more - they were the first to go, so I do recommend lots if your family eats them.   I added 3 small onions to my clay pot, and next time, I think I'll also add some cut up cabbage.  Also, the chicken will make its own juice in the pot.  After cooking, I put the chicken in a pan under the broiler for a couple of minutes to further brown/crisp it, removed the veggies to a serving dish, and defatted the chicken liquid to serve alongside.

Next time I’ll make sure to get plenty of cream in case I need to redo the custard layer. Make sure you cook the custard on the lowest heat on your stove, and don’t let it thicken too long!!'),\n",

As for the chicken itself, I loved the use of herbs and did add two more: oregano and sage. A great combination which really gave the chicken a wonderful flavour. I used fresh garlic which (as I usually do!) I doubled and minced and mixed in with the herbs. I used the olive oil and in step nine went with option #1. We SO enjoyed this for dinner several nights ago and what we didn't eat then, we thoroughly enjoyed with baby spinach leaves in the most delicious chicken sandwiches. YUM!

For me it works best on a more thinly cut french fry like that which McDonald's has and spread them out on a cookie sheet so that no fry overlaps another.  I cook them a little longer in the oven than what the recipe states and I leave the skins on for the vitamin/mineral content they supposedly add,  but that's the only thing I had to change.  The salt content in these is perfect for my tastes but for someone that does not like salt as much myself I would recommend lowering the salt used by maybe a quarter or half.  Boiling the fries in the salt water is what really makes this recipe shine.  They cook crisp on the outside and soft in the middle, unlike most the other healthy fry recipes Ive found.  Soooo yummy and as long as you are accounting for the calories, these are just fine for most of you dieters out there.

I just need to figure out how to cut down the mass quantity of servings this recipe makes.  That's still okay, because the leftovers are awesome.\"),\n",

The problem with mac n cheese recipes, is that people usually think the putting many kinds of cheese in a the recipe, somehow makes it the best.  Problem with that philosophy, is that after a while, the dish becomes overly rich.  This dish, uses a lot of Velveeta and cheddar, but the mushroom soup, makes it different, but no one will know ever know that you've got it in there, even the mushroom haters.  I know now that I will never need another recipe for my favorite comfort food.  What I need is about 3 or 4 more stars so I could give this eight stars.  Try it and I think you'll agree.\"),\n",

Make your own, then you can tweak it as suits your taste if you must use seasoning. You can use mild chile powder, cumin and Greek oregano. If you use Mexican oregano use only a little as it is very strong. Traditional Mexican food does not use garlic. This is all you need without all the other additives of packaged. No fillers, no preservatives and fresher this way. Canned chiles are Anaheim chiles unless you buy adobo. Anaheim chiles are very mild. Anaheim chiles or Poblano chiles (hotter) are the ones used for chile relleno. Top them with homemade salsa. Not all Mexicans like spicy or hot spicy foods.

The flavor is really good...I may have to go back and make more because I've had 3 or 4 of them this afternoon alone!  I got 28 huge meringues - and yes, they do turn out huge (expect them to puff up a little more while baking).  Next time I would probably make them a little smaller so as to get more out of the batch and perhaps end up with something a little more bite-sized.  Bake time in my oven was just over 45 minutes.

       "  \"a translucent golden-brown crust allows the green of the avocado to be seen.  the crispy exterior is a counterpoint to the unctuous interior.  these are a signature dish for me, and the one i most often get requests to make (although my seafood and ricotta stuffed buckwheat pancakes run a close second).\\n\\nthese fritters came about ten years ago when i was shopping for a dinner i was making for a friend who is a cia-trained chef.  i was in a vegetable market and saw these gorgeous avocados that i just knew would be ripe in the next two days.  i tried to think of what i could do with them since a) everyone serves cold avocado, and b) i really am not fond of guacamole.  as i tried to think of what i could make with them that was hot, the work 'fritters' jumped into my head.  having never made a fritter before, i was a little surprised to have that thought; but having never known when a vegetable was going to be ripe before i figured i was on a roll and decided to go for it.\\n\\nto serve with my never-before-tried-fritters, i decided to make a crème fraîche-lime-cayenne dipping sauce.  so i made fresh crème fraîche, and used it as a base not only for this dip, but for a tia maria sauce to go with the flourless chocolate cake i made for dessert (another never-before made item, but with the recipe from cook's illustrated it was the only thing i wasn't making up as i went along).\\n\\nthe result of the fritters was that i got to taste the test fritter, then had to dive across the couch before the last one was devoured in order to have a second.\\n\\nthe one evolution in the recipe is the change from cayenne to chipotle in the dip.  i like the smokiness, and it gives a rough edge to something very smooth - i am all about contrast.  feel free to use whatever chile or combination thereof that you like best.  this dip is easy and stands on it's own at a party for anything you want to dip into it.  i have also made it with vegan sour cream with great results.\\n\\nthe name alligator claws comes from an alternate name for the avocado: the alligator pear, as well as the fact that the wedges of avocado look like claws.\\n\\n(for those not familiar with the name alligator pear, it derives from both the tough, textured exterior - reminiscent of an alligator's hide, and the fact that you really can't eat one until it softens - just like a pear.)\\n\\nalligator claws are also a great name to call them if you have kids who either won't eat anything that sounds weird and you want to keep them to yourself, or - if you want your kids to eat them - if you have kids who'll only eat things that will gross other people out.\\n\\nif you are preparing these for kids (and i recommend you do whatever name you choose to call them), protect their palates and tone down the heat of the sauce.  maybe skip the chiles altogether and put in just a hint of finely ground pepper (white pepper won't look like black specks throughout the dip - i'm normally not that fussy, but it's something kids will notice).\\n\\nallow half an avocado per person.  this is so rich that more is too much.\\n\\nnote:\\nyou can easily cut the recipe in half, all the batter is is a one-to-one mix of flour & water (someone has suggested trying tempura batter which comes in a mix at many supermarkets - i tend to be a from-scratch kind of guy.  or do i just mean itchy?).\\n\\nenjoy.\\n\\n-- text by michael david winter, aka the poker roach\",\n",
